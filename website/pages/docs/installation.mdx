# Installation

## Requirements

- React 18.0 or later
- Node.js 16.0 or later

## Package Manager

Choose your preferred package manager to install Day Flow:

### npm

```bash
npm install dayflow
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add dayflow
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add dayflow
```

## TypeScript

Day Flow is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```tsx
import type { CalendarAppConfig, Event } from 'dayflow';
```

## Styling

The calendar comes with default styles, but you can customize them:

### Using CSS

```tsx
import 'dayflow/dist/styles.css';
```

### Custom Styling

You can override the default styles by providing your own CSS or using styled-components:

```tsx
import { DayFlowCalendar } from 'dayflow';
import './my-calendar-styles.css';
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation:

1. Make sure your Node.js version is 16.0 or later
2. Clear your package manager cache:
   - npm: `npm cache clean --force`
   - yarn: `yarn cache clean`
   - pnpm: `pnpm store prune`
3. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies
