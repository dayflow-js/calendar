## Year View Reimagined in DayFlow v2.0.3

### Year Canvas

The year-canvas mode provides the ability to '**Year as one canvas**' and see the distribution of events for an entire year at once.

### Fixed Week Year View

We have completely reimagined the Year View (`FixedWeekYearView`) to provide a more powerful and continuous planning experience.

- **Continuous Grid Layout**: Instead of 12 separate month grids, the year is now displayed as a continuous, scrollable grid of weeks. This "Fixed Week" layout aligns weeks vertically, making it perfect for long-term planning.
- **Multi-Day Event Support**: Events spanning multiple days, weeks, or even months are now rendered as continuous bars, providing a clear visual representation of duration and overlap.
- **Drag & Drop**: Full support for interactive event management.
  - **Move**: Drag events to reschedule them.
  - **Resize**: Drag the edges of an event to change its duration.
  - **Create**: Double-click any day to quickly create a new event.
- **Timed Events Display**: A new configuration option `showTimedEventsInYearView` allows you to choose whether to display dot indicators for timed events alongside all-day event bars.

### Customization

- **Weekend Styling**: Added global CSS classes `df-year-view-weekend-header` and `df-year-view-weekend-cell` to easily customize the background color and appearance of weekends in the Year View.

### Bug Fixes

- **Week View**: Fixed an issue where clicking on the Week View could incorrectly trigger the drag indicator display.
- **Event Rendering**: Resolved issues with all-day event rendering limits in Month View and Day View, ensuring events are correctly stacked and hidden/shown based on available space.
- **Scroll Synchronisation**: Improved the synchronisation between the week header, month sidebar, and content grid in the Year View.

### Upgrading

To use the new Year View features, ensure you are using the latest version of `@dayflow/core`.

```bash
npm install @dayflow/core@latest
```

The new Year View is enabled by default when using `createYearView()`.

```tsx
import { createYearView } from '@dayflow/core';

// ... in your useCalendarApp config
views: [
  createYearView({
    mode: 'fixed-week', // default is year-canvas
    showTimedEventsInYearView: true, // Enable dots for timed events
  }),
];
```
