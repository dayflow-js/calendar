# Plugins Overview

Day Flow uses a plugin architecture to extend functionality. Plugins provide modular features that can be enabled, disabled, or configured based on your needs.

## Why Plugins?

The plugin system allows you to:

- **Enable/disable features** - Only load what you need (e.g., only English by default to save bundle size)
- **Configure behavior** - Customize plugin settings for specific use cases
- **Extend functionality** - Create custom plugins for your unique requirements
- **Access plugin APIs** - Use plugin services directly in your business logic

## Available Plugins

Day Flow provides several built-in and official plugins:

### [i18n](../localization)

Support for multiple languages. Extracting non-English locales into a plugin allows for a smaller core bundle for English-only applications.

### [Drag & Drop](../drag)

Enables interactive event management including moving, resizing, and double-click to create events.

### [Events Service](../events)

Provides advanced event management capabilities including validation, filtering, and date-range querying.

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Plugin Creation** - Call the factory function (e.g., `createDragPlugin()`) with your configuration.
2. **Plugin Registration** - Add the plugin instance to the `plugins` array when initializing your calendar.
3. **Installation** - The `install()` function is automatically called with the `CalendarApp` instance.
4. **Usage** - Access plugin APIs via `app.getPlugin('plugin-name')`.

## Creating Custom Plugins

You can create your own plugins to extend calendar functionality by implementing the `CalendarPlugin` interface:

```tsx copy
import { CalendarPlugin, ICalendarApp } from '@dayflow/core';

export const myPlugin: CalendarPlugin = {
  name: 'my-custom-plugin',
  install(app: ICalendarApp) {
    console.log('Plugin installed!');
    // Extend app functionality here
  },
};
```
