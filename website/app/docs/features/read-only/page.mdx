# Read-only Mode

You can easily make the calendar read-only to prevent user modifications. This is useful for public calendars or display-only dashboards.

## Basic Usage

To enable read-only mode, pass `readOnly: true` to the calendar configuration.

```tsx
const calendar = useCalendarApp({
  views: [createMonthView()],
  readOnly: true, // Disables all interactions (dragging, creating, editing)
});
```

## Fine-grained Control

You can also provide a `ReadOnlyConfig` object to selectively disable certain features:

```tsx
const calendar = useCalendarApp({
  views: [createMonthView()],
  readOnly: {
    draggable: false, // Disables drag-and-drop
    viewable: true,   // Allows clicking to view event details (read-only mode)
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `draggable` | `boolean` | Whether events can be moved or resized via drag-and-drop. |
| `viewable` | `boolean` | Whether event details can be viewed (opens the detail panel/dialog). |

When `readOnly` is active, the calendar will also hide "Create" buttons and other UI elements that would normally trigger changes.
