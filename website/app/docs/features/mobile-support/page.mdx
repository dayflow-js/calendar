# Mobile Support

DayFlow provides built-in support for mobile devices. The calendar automatically adapts its layout and interactions to provide a smooth experience on smaller screens.

## Responsive Layouts

All views (Day, Week, Month) are designed to be responsive:

- **Month View**: Hides event times and uses compact "more events" indicators. It also employs gradient-fade truncation for event titles to maximize readability.
- **Week & Day Views**: Automatically shrink the time column and simplify date labels to fit narrower widths.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar automatically collapses on mobile to save space, but remains accessible via a toggle.
- **Header**: The view switcher automatically switches to `select` mode on mobile to prevent crowding.

## Mobile Interactions

DayFlow introduces mobile-specific interactions to make managing events easy:

- **Long Press to Move**: On mobile, press and hold an event for 500ms to initiate a drag-and-drop move.
- **Resize Indicators**: When an event is selected (via long press or tap), large touch-friendly handles appear at the corners for easy resizing.
- **Event Drawer**: Tapping an event opens a bottom-sheet style drawer for viewing or editing details, providing a native-app feel.
- **Search Dialog**: On mobile, clicking the search icon opens a full-screen search dialog with large results.

## Customization

You can provide a custom component for the mobile event drawer/dialog using the `customMobileEventRenderer` option.

```tsx
const calendar = useCalendarApp({
  // ...
  customMobileEventRenderer: MyCustomMobileDrawer,
});
```

The custom component will receive props like `isOpen`, `onClose`, `draftEvent`, and the `app` instance.
