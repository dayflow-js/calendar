# Calendar Views

Day Flow supports four different view types, each optimized for different use cases and user needs. You can switch between views programmatically or provide a UI for users to switch views.

## Available Views

### Month View

The month view displays a traditional calendar grid showing all days in a month.

**Best for:**

- Viewing events across the entire month
- Getting an overview of upcoming events
- Drag and drop event management
- Multi-day event visualization

**Features:**

- Virtual scrolling for smooth performance
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Multi-day event spanning
- Drag to create events
- Drag to move events
- Resize events
- All-day events support

```tsx copy {10}
import {
  useCalendarApp,
  DayFlowCalendar,
  createMonthView,
  ViewType,
} from '@dayflow/core';

function MyCalendar() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    views: [createMonthView()],
    defaultView: ViewType.MONTH,
    initialDate: new Date(),
  });

  return <DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />;
}
```

### Week View

The week view displays a 7-day grid with time slots, showing events with their exact start and end times.

**Best for:**

- Detailed time management
- Scheduling meetings and appointments
- Viewing events with precise timing
- Time-based event editing

**Features:**

- Hourly time slots (24-hour format)
- Current time indicator
- All-day events row
- Multi-day events spanning across the week
- Drag and drop for event creation and management
- Resize events to adjust duration
- Double-click to create events
- Collision detection and smart event positioning

```tsx copy {10}
import {
  useCalendarApp,
  DayFlowCalendar,
  createWeekView,
  ViewType,
} from '@dayflow/core';

function MyCalendar() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    views: [createWeekView()],
    defaultView: ViewType.WEEK,
    initialDate: new Date(),
  });

  return <DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />;
}
```

### Day View

The day view focuses on a single day with detailed time slots, perfect for managing daily schedules.

**Best for:**

- Focus on daily tasks
- Detailed daily planning
- Avoiding distractions from other days
- Mobile-friendly single-day view

**Features:**

- 24-hour time grid
- Current time indicator
- Mini calendar sidebar for date navigation
- Event list for the selected day
- All-day events section
- Drag and drop support
- Resize events
- Event detail panel

**Layout:**

- Left side (70%): Time grid with events
- Right side (30%): Mini calendar and event list

```tsx copy {10}
import {
  useCalendarApp,
  DayFlowCalendar,
  createDayView,
  ViewType,
} from '@dayflow/core';

function MyCalendar() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    views: [createDayView()],
    defaultView: ViewType.DAY,
    initialDate: new Date(),
  });

  return <DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />;
}
```

### Year View

The year view provides a comprehensive annual overview using a "Fixed Week" layout. Unlike traditional year views that just show 12 small calendars, DayFlow's Year View renders a continuous grid where you can visualize multi-day events spanning across days, weeks, and even months.

**Best for:**

- Long-term planning and roadmapping
- Visualizing project timelines and holidays
- Annual leave management
- High-level schedule overview

**Features:**

- **Continuous Grid Layout:** Displays the entire year in a scrollable, unified grid.
- **Multi-day Event Visualization:** Events are rendered as continuous bars, making it easy to see duration and overlaps.
- **Drag and Drop:** Full support for moving and resizing events directly in the year view.
- **Event Creation:** Double-click any day to create a new event.
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Optimized performance for rendering thousands of events.
- **Timed Events:** Option to show or hide timed events (dots/indicators) alongside all-day events.

```tsx copy {10}
import {
  useCalendarApp,
  DayFlowCalendar,
  createYearView,
  ViewType,
} from '@dayflow/core';

function MyCalendar() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    views: [
      createYearView({
        showTimedEventsInYearView: true, // Optional: show timed events
      }),
    ],
    defaultView: ViewType.YEAR,
    initialDate: new Date(),
  });

  return <DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />;
}
```

## Using Multiple Views

You can register multiple views and allow users to switch between them:

```tsx copy {13-18}
import {
  useCalendarApp,
  DayFlowCalendar,
  createDayView,
  createWeekView,
  createMonthView,
  createYearView,
  ViewType,
} from '@dayflow/core';

function MultiViewCalendar() {
  const calendar = useCalendarApp({
    views: [
      createDayView(),
      createWeekView(),
      createMonthView(),
      createYearView(),
    ],
    defaultView: ViewType.MONTH,
    initialDate: new Date(),
    callbacks: {
      onViewChange: view => {
        console.log('View changed to:', view);
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <div className="h-screen flex flex-col">
      {/* View Switcher */}
      <div className="border-b p-4">
        <div className="flex gap-2">
          <button onClick={() => calendar.changeView(ViewType.DAY)}>Day</button>
          <button onClick={() => calendar.changeView(ViewType.WEEK)}>
            Week
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => calendar.changeView(ViewType.MONTH)}>
            Month
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => calendar.changeView(ViewType.YEAR)}>
            Year
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Calendar */}
      <div className="flex-1">
        <DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Programmatic View Control

### Changing Views

```tsx copy
// Change to a specific view
calendar.changeView(ViewType.WEEK);

// Get current view
const currentView = calendar.app.getCurrentView();
console.log(currentView.type); // 'week'
```

### Navigation

All views support the same navigation methods:

```tsx copy
// Go to today
calendar.goToToday();

// Go to previous period (day/week/month/year depending on current view)
calendar.goToPrevious();

// Go to next period
calendar.goToNext();

// Go to a specific date
calendar.selectDate(new Date(2024, 9, 15));
```

## ViewType Enum

```tsx copy
enum ViewType {
  DAY = 'day',
  WEEK = 'week',
  MONTH = 'month',
  YEAR = 'year',
}
```
