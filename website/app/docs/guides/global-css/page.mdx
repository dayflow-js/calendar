## Usage Tips

1. **Specificity**: If your styles don't apply, you may need to increase specificity:
   ```css
   .your-calendar-wrapper .df-year-event-title {
     text-align: center;
   }
   ```

2. **Dark Mode**: Always consider dark mode when customizing:
   ```css
   .df-year-event-title {
     color: #333;
   }
   .dark .df-year-event-title {
     color: #eee;
   }
   ```

3. **Responsive Design**: Use media queries for different screen sizes:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .df-year-event-title {
       font-size: 9px;
     }
   }
   ```
