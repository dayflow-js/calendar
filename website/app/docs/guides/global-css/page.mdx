## How to Customize

To customize the appearance, you can target these classes in your global CSS file. Since DayFlow uses Tailwind CSS internally, you might need to use `!important` or increase selector specificity if your styles are being overridden.

### Example

```css
/* Change the background of all events */
.df-event {
  border-radius: 8px !important;
}

/* Customize the current time indicator */
.df-current-time-line {
  z-index: 100;
}
.df-current-time-bar {
  height: 3px !important;
  background-color: #ef4444 !important;
}

/* Customize specific view */
.df-day-view .df-event {
  border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;
}

/* Style the sidebar */
.df-sidebar {
  background-color: #f8fafc !important;
}

/* Style mini calendar */
.df-mini-calendar-day:hover {
  background-color: #e2e8f0;
}

/* Dark mode overrides */
.dark .df-calendar {
  background-color: #111827;
}

/* Style event detail panel */
.df-event-detail-panel {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) !important;
}
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Specificity**: If your styles don't apply, increase specificity by wrapping the calendar in a custom class:
   ```css
   .my-custom-calendar .df-event { ... }
   ```

2. **Responsive Design**: Use media queries to adjust styles for mobile devices:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .df-event-title { font-size: 10px; }
     .df-time-label { font-size: 10px; }
   }
   ```

3. **Dark Mode**: Use the `.dark` selector for dark mode specific styles:
   ```css
   .dark .df-month-day-cell {
     border-color: #374151;
   }
   ```

4. **CSS Variables**: DayFlow uses CSS custom properties for colors. Override them for global color changes:
   ```css
   :root {
     --primary: #3b82f6;
     --primary-foreground: #ffffff;
   }
   ```
